Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

# [PROJECT 1](https://jesperba01.github.io/Project-1)

World Of Warcraft For Beginners

This website is a helping hand for new players or just people intrested in WOW(World of warcraft).
The game has been out for 19 years and is one of the largest games out there so its understable why it can be a little "much" for new people.
This website focuses more on the character and class selection part of the game so that you can get started and learn more as you progress.

Here is a mockup of the website

![screenshot](documentation/mockup.png)

## UX

For the design i wanted to include a vibrant picture of the game and its characters but also keep it kinda dark and mysterious like the game is.
so i went whit a vibrant home page and a dark theme for the rest of the pages.

### Colour Scheme

- `#333` used for navbar
- `#04aa6d` used for navbar and links in list highlights.
- `#17130f` used for background color second, fourth and fifth page.
- `#1a1c1b` used for background color home page.
- `#FFD700` used for em highlights and tool tip.
- `#a803a6` used for em in lists.
- `white` used for primary text.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/a803a6-ffd700-1a1c1b-04aa6d-333333) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like Google Fonts and/or Font Awesome.

Consider adding a link to each font used, and the Font Awesome site if used (or similar icon library).

Example:

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to design my site wireframes.
